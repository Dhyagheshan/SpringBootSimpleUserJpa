SpringBoot gets User values and Stores in H2 Database

In application.properties give your preferred db name. I have given as sbdemo

After running the project go to "http://localhost:<yourportnumber>/" and give inputs.

You can go to "http://localhost:<yourportnumber>/h2-console" to open h2 database console, where you can view your database table.
